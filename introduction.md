#Introduction

When discussing a topic, its important that we have agreed upon a clear definition of the terms we use and that we share that same horizon of understanding.  

This is especially true when we start exploring a term like web design, which thanks to its relatively loose definition and blurry edges, has as many interpretations as there are people trying to define it.  

With this in mind, it will be helpful if we start out by establishing a definition for the term web design that can be used for the rest of this tutorial.

To me, the term web design has evolved to become the umbrella term that encompasses all the disciplines that go together to create a website.  

These include the old web design principals, graphic and interface design, authoring, user experience design, search engine optimization, etc. as well as the other disciplines involved in the creating and providing a website, content strategy, information architecture, front and back-end development, even infrastructure and system architecture.  

Going forward, I will use web design as the catchall term that holds within it all the roles and disciplines that go together to bring the idea of a website to fruition, as the presentation of live content on the web.
